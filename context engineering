Slide 1: The Concept

Title: Effective Context Engineering: The Core Idea

What is it?

The natural evolution of prompt engineering.

Managing the entire set of information (context) for an AI agent.

Why is it Critical?

An AI's context window is a limited "attention budget."

"Context Rot": Performance degrades as the context window fills with information.

The Goal

Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens to get the desired result.

Primary Strategy

"Just in Time" Context: Instead of pre-loading, have agents use tools to fetch data precisely when needed.

Slide 2: The Techniques

Title: Context Engineering: Advanced Techniques

For Efficient Design:

Prompts: Be clear and direct; not too vague, not too rigid.

Tools: Design them to be token-efficient and functionally distinct.

Examples: Use a few diverse, canonical examples (not an exhaustive list).

For Long-Horizon Tasks (Beyond the Context Window):

Compaction: Summarize the history and start a new context with the summary.

Structured Note-Taking: The agent writes to and reads from an external "memory" file.

Sub-agents: A "manager" agent coordinates specialized sub-agents to handle focused tasks.
